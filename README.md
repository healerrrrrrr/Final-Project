 The web app of fianl project

Completed by Yuxin Ou and Qiunina Li

Two questions about our analysis on Chocolate Bar:
 - analyze the relationship between counts of ingredients and cocoa percent
 - Cocoa percent distribution of chocolate on the market

Four different types of plots about our analysis on Chocolate Bar:
 - A pie chart about companies location
 - A histogram about cocoa beans origin countries
 - A line chart ahout the cocoa percent of the chocolate
 - A boxplot about the relationship of the count of ingredients and rating of cocoa

A map on the app to show the companies location

Three different types of filtering widgets in the sidebar:
 - A slider to show the cocoa percent
 - A mutiple widget to filter the top 15 companies location type
 - A mutiple widget to filter the top 15 companies cocoa beans origin type
 - A radio button widget to filter by the cocoa percent level, Low(<3), Medium(>=3 & <4), High(>=4)

We can interact between the sidebar and the map and plots
